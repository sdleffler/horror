## Horror: Generic C data structures

As a disclaimer, I am perfectly aware that there are established libraries for data structures in C out there. They're great; they're optimized; they're probably not going to blow up in your face. I wrote this library to get the feel of C back into my fingers, and while it seems to pass all the unit tests (of which there are admittedly only a few here), it is probably not safe for any real use. Eventually, that may change as I will be making heavy use of the library as part of [laser](https://github.com/sdleffler/laser).

## Running tests

Tests can be run with `make test`.

## Notes

Currently supported structures:

### Red-black tree - `horror/rbtree.c`

Example usage (edited from test):

```
#include "horror/rbtree.h"

#define RB_SCOPE HR_SCOPE_STATIC_INLINE
#define RB_ELEM_TYPE int
#define RB_TYPE rb_int
#define RB_CMP(x, y) ((x) < (y) ? -1 : ((x) > (y) ? 1 : 0))
#include "horror/rbtree.c"
```

All `#define`'d symbols are automatically `#undef`'d. The options available for `horror/rbtree.c` are:

- `RB_ELEM_TYPE` - the type of the element stored. For the example above, the tree stores `int`s.
- `RB_NAME` - the generated red-black tree type will end up as `<RB_NAME>_t`, and generated functions will be `<RB_NAME>_<FUNCTION>`.
- `RB_CMP` - the ordering for the red-black tree. Can be a macro - it will never be called with effectful arguments, so no need to worry about using macro arguments multiple times. A value of less than zero indicates the first argument is less than the second, a value of zero indicates the two arguments are equal, and a value of greater than zero indicates the first argument is greater than the second. `horror/rbtree.c` expects the returned values to be signed `int`s.
- `RB_STORAGE` - the storage type for the red-black tree. `horror` supplies three different storage types for most structures - `HR_STORAGE_DIRECT`, `HR_STORAGE_OWNED_INDIRECT`, and `HR_STORAGE_BORROWED_INDIRECT`:
    - `RB_STORAGE=HR_STORAGE_DIRECT` - the values are stored directly in the nodes of the tree, no pointers or malloc'd memory aside from that allocated for the nodes themselves.
    - `RB_STORAGE=HR_STORAGE_OWNED_INDIRECT` - unless `RB_MALLOC_ELEM` and `RB_FREE_ELEM` are specified, defaults to `malloc` and `free` from `stdlib.h` to allocate memory to store the elements.
    - `RB_STORAGE=HR_STORAGE_BORROWED_INDIRECT` - this is for if you're just using the tree to get access to stuff you've allocated somewhere else. Basically the same as `HR_STORAGE_OWNED_INDIRECT`, but the tree won't allocate or free anything. A roughly similar effect to simply storing pointers.
- `RB_MALLOC_ELEM` - the allocator for elements. If unspecified, defaults to `malloc`. *Important: `RB_MALLOC_ELEM` is expected to be a macro! `horror/rbtree.c` uses `#if defined(RB_MALLOC_ELEM)` to check if it is supplied.* `horror/rbtree.c` will `#error` if `RB_MALLOC_ELEM` is supplied without a custom `RB_FREE_ELEM`.
- `RB_FREE_ELEM` - for defining custom release behavior. If unspecified, defaults to `free`. *Important: `RB_FREE_ELEM` is expected to be a macro! `horror/rbtree.c` uses `#if defined(RB_FREE_ELEM)` to check if it is supplied.* `horror/rbtree.c` will `#error` if `RB_FREE_ELEM` is supplied without a custom `RB_MALLOC_ELEM`.
- `RB_MEMCPY_ELEM` - if `RB_MEMCPY_ELEM` is supplied, then even if `RB_STORAGE` is set to `HR_STORAGE_DIRECT`, all functions which require an element to be supplied will instead expect a pointer, and `RB_MEMCPY_ELEM` will be used to copy that data into the node. If `RB_MEMCPY_ELEM` is supplied when `RB_STORAGE` is set to `HR_STORAGE_BORROWED_INDIRECT`, then copying data into newly allocated space will be done with `RB_MEMCPY_ELEM`. If `RB_STORAGE` is set to `HR_STORAGE_BORROWED_INDIRECT`, setting `RB_MEMCPY_ELEM` will have no effect. (TODO: cause `horror/rbtree.c` to `#error` if this is done.)
- `RB_MALLOC_NODE` - `horror/rbtree.c` uses `malloc` to allocate memory for nodes by default. If you want it to use something else, then `#define RB_MALLOC_NODE (my_allocator_here(sizeof(RB_NODE)))`.
- `RB_FREE_NODE` - see `RB_MALLOC_NODE`.
- `RB_TRAV` - the identifier used for the traversal iterator. If set, the new iterator struct will be named `<RB_TRAV>_t`.
- `RB_SCOPE` - the scope to generate the functions in:
    - `#undef RB_SCOPE` - no special scope. (TODO: Make this an error instead.)
    - `RB_SCOPE=HR_SCOPE_STATIC` - functions are declared as `static`.
    - `RB_SCOPE=HR_SCOPE_STATIC_INLINE` - functions are declared as `static inline`.
    - `RB_SCOPE=HR_SCOPE_HEADER` - only prototypes are declared.
    - `RB_SCOPE=HR_SCOPE_EXTERN_INLINE` - only prototypes are declared, and declared as `extern inline`.
- `RB_TRAV_DEPTH_MAX=64` - the maximum depth for the traversal iterator. (TODO: Make the traversal iterator capable of handling arbitrary depths.) `RB_TRAV_DEPTH_MAX=64` should be enough, since due to the balancing of the red-black tree, you'd have to have `2 log n + 1 = 64  =>  log n = 32  =>  n == 2^32` nodes to run out of space.

The full list of `#undefs` for `horror/rbtree.c` is:

- `#undef RB_ELEM_TYPE`
- `#undef RB_CMP`
- `#undef RB_STORAGE`
- `#undef RB_MALLOC_ELEM`
- `#undef RB_FREE_ELEM`
- `#undef RB_MEMCPY_ELEM`
- `#undef RB_MALLOC_NODE`
- `#undef RB_FREE_NODE`
- `#undef RB_TYPE`
- `#undef RB_NODE`
- `#undef RB_TRAV`
- `#undef RB_SCOPE`
- `#undef RB_FUNC`
- `#undef NAME_`
- `#undef RB_TRAV_DEPTH_MAX`
- `#undef RB_DEBUG`
- `#undef RB_DEBUG_DUMP`

Those of which do not appear above are used internally, but since the C preprocessor is a horrible, nasty, lumbering beast which should have been put down years ago, they still may affect your code if you use them. Please be careful.

### Dynamically resizable array - `horror/dynarray.c`

TODO: Allow the array to shrink its allocated memory. (Currently only grows with insertion.)

Example usage (edited from test):
```
#define DA_SCOPE HR_SCOPE_STATIC_INLINE
#define DA_ELEM_TYPE int
#define DA_NAME da_int
#include "horror/dynarray.c"
```

As with `horror/rbtree.c`, all `#define`'d options are automatically `#undef`'d. Unlike `horror/rbtree.c`, however, `horror/dynarray.c` does not have a header file (since all generated red-black trees share use of the `rbdir_t` type. TODO: Get rid of `horror/rbtree.c`'s header requirement.) The options available for `horror/dynarray.c` are:

- `DA_ELEM_TYPE` - the type of the element stored in the array.
- `DA_NAME` - like the red-black tree, the name of the generated type. (See `RB_NAME`.)
- `DA_STORAGE` - the storage type. If `DA_STORAGE` is set to anything other than `HR_STORAGE_DIRECT`, that makes the array store pointers instead of the actual data, which kind of voids the purpose of the array. So beware. (See `RB_STORAGE` for more information about storage types.)
- `DA_MALLOC_ELEM`, `DA_FREE_ELEM`, `DA_MEMCPY_ELEM` - custom allocation, release, and copy logic. Similar behavior to `RB_MALLOC_ELEM`, `RB_FREE_ELEM`, and `RB_MEMCPY_ELEM`.
- `DA_TYPE` - if you really don't want your dynamically resizable array type to be named `<DA_NAME>_t`, you can change this.
- `DA_SCOPE` - see `RB_SCOPE` for an explanation of the available function scope options.
- `DA_BOUNDS_CHECK` - if defined, calls to `assert` will be generated ensuring that accesses into the dynamic array are within bounds. If you want to rely on this, don't directly access the memory in the array - you can, but don't. Seriously.

The full list of `#undefs` for `horror/dynarray.c` is:

- `#undef DA_ELEM_TYPE`
- `#undef DA_NAME`
- `#undef DA_STORAGE`
- `#undef DA_MALLOC_ELEM`
- `#undef DA_FREE_ELEM`
- `#undef DA_MEMCPY_ELEM`
- `#undef DA_TYPE`
- `#undef DA_SCOPE`
- `#undef DA_FUNC`
- `#undef NAME_`
- `#undef DA_BOUNDS_CHECK`
- `#undef DA_DEBUG`
- `#undef DA_DEBUG_DUMP`

### Binary heap - `horror/heap.c`

TODO: Allow the heap to shrink its allocated memory. (Currently only grows with insertion.)

Example usage (edited from test):
```
#define HP_SCOPE HR_SCOPE_STATIC_INLINE
#define HP_ELEM_TYPE int
#define HP_NAME hp_int
#define HP_CMP(x, y) ((x) < (y) ? true : false)
#define HP_STORAGE HR_STORAGE_DIRECT
#include "horror/heap.c"
```

The options available for `horror/heap.c` are:

- `HP_ELEM_TYPE` - the type of the value to store in the heap.
- `HP_NAME` - see `RB_NAME` and `DA_NAME`.
- `HP_CMP` - the heap's comparison function should return a boolean value indicating whether one element precedes the other. For the provided example, the comparator given produces a min-heap.
- `HP_STORAGE` - see `DA_STORAGE`. Internally, `horror/heap.c` is very similar to `horror/dynarray.c`, so the behavior here is the same.
- `HP_MALLOC_ELEM` - see `DA_MALLOC_ELEM`.
- `HP_FREE_ELEM` - see `DA_FREE_ELEM`.
- `HP_TYPE` - see `DA_TYPE`.
- `HP_SCOPE` - see `RB_SCOPE`

The full list of `#undefs` for `horror/heap.c` is:

- `#undef HP_ELEM_TYPE`
- `#undef HP_NAME`
- `#undef HP_CMP`
- `#undef HP_STORAGE`
- `#undef HP_MALLOC_ELEM`
- `#undef HP_FREE_ELEM`
- `#undef HP_MEMCPY_ELEM`
- `#undef HP_TYPE`
- `#undef HP_SCOPE`
- `#undef HP_FUNC`
- `#undef NAME_`
- `#undef HP_PARENT`
- `#undef HP_LEFT`
- `#undef HP_RIGHT`
- `#undef HP_DEBUG`
- `#undef HP_DEBUG_DUMP`
